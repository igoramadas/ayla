// AYLA SETTINGS
// Ayla uses the Expresser platform, therefore I recommend having a look
// at https://expresser.codeplex.com to understand how settings work.
// The properties below are the defaults for Ayla, and do not include
// private API keys, tokens, passwords, user preferences etc. For this
// you'll have to create a settings.private.json file.

{
    // Web app defaults, please note that for SSL to work you'll need to have
    // a ssl.key and ssl.cer files. The `cookieTokenExpireDays` defines how
    // many days a token will be saved as cookie when user access the app
    // with a token and passing savecookie=1.
